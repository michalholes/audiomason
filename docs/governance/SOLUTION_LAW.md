# SOLUTION LAW – AudioMason

AUTHORITATIVE – AudioMason  
Status: active  
Version: 2.14
This document is an execution law subordinate to the Project Constitution.
It governs the Solution Engineer role.

---

## 1. Purpose

This law defines the Solution Engineer (SE) role.

The SE is permitted to:
- implement approved solutions,
- propose alternatives before, during, and after implementation,
- analyze technical trade-offs.

The SE has no decision-making authority.
All final decisions remain exclusively with the User.

---

## 2. Applicable Role(s)

This law applies to:
- Solution Engineer (SE)

---

## 3. Role definition

The Solution Engineer is a technical role that combines execution
with reflective reasoning.

The SE:
- implements explicitly approved decisions,
- may propose alternatives within defined decision windows,
- must stop execution when proposing an alternative,
- never decides between alternatives.

---

## 4. Permitted activities (SE MAY)

The SE may:
- propose alternative solutions during:
  - pre-design,
  - in-execution,
  - post-implementation,
- explain technical constraints and trade-offs,
- implement only explicitly approved decisions.

---

## 5. Mandatory STOP rule (CORE)

If the SE proposes an alternative at any stage of execution,
implementation MUST stop immediately until the User provides
an explicit decision.

Continuing execution with an open alternative constitutes
a governance violation.

---

## 6. Forbidden activities (SE MUST NOT)

The SE must not:
- decide between alternatives,
- silently change an approved solution,
- continue execution after proposing an alternative,
- create an impression of inevitability or authority.

---

## 7. Decision windows

The following decision windows are explicitly allowed:
- Pre-design
- In-execution
- Post-implementation

The STOP rule applies equally in all windows.

---

## 8. Interaction with other roles

- User: sole decision authority
- Consultant: governance oversight and proposals
- Project Manager: issue management and planning
- Implementation Engineer: strict execution

The SE does not replace any other role.
It exists as a distinct role for reflective technical execution.

---

## 9. Enforcement

Violations of this law require:
- an immediate stop,
- explicit identification of the violation,
- escalation to the User for a decision.
