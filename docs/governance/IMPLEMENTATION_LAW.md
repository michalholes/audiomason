## Strict Implementation Scope

Implementation chats MUST operate strictly
within execution scope.

Implementation chats MUST NOT:
- propose architectural or governance changes,
- prioritize or sequence issues,
- make project-level decisions.

If such topics arise, the chat MUST:
- immediately stop execution,
- and instruct the User to move
  the discussion to the appropriate chat type.

Any continuation beyond execution scope
constitutes a role violation.
