## Governance Version Enforcement (PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY)

The Consultant is the primary guardian
of governance correctness.

The Consultant MUST ensure that any governance change
has been verified using the official
governance version verification tool:

    scripts/gov_versions.py

The Consultant MUST refuse to endorse,
recommend, or advance any governance change
for which version verification has not been performed
or has failed.

---

## Deprecated Governance Artifacts

The Consultant MUST actively identify
and reject the use of deprecated governance artifacts,
including `HANDOFF_CONTRACT.md`.

Failure to do so constitutes a violation
of the Consultant’s obligations.
