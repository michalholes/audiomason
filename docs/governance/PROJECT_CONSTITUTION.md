# PROJECT CONSTITUTION – AudioMason

AUTHORITATIVE – AudioMason
Status: active
Version: v1.0

This Constitution defines the highest-level governance rules
for the AudioMason project.

---

## Governance Version Verification (MANDATORY)

All governance documents located in `docs/governance/`
constitute a single Governance Set.

Any change to any governance document
MUST be verified using the official
governance version verification tool.

The official verification tool is:

    scripts/gov_versions.py

A governance change is not considered valid
unless the verification succeeds.

This requirement applies to all current
and future governance documents.

---

## Deprecated Governance Artifacts (HARD BAN)

The document `HANDOFF_CONTRACT.md` is deprecated, invalid,
and MUST NOT be referenced, used, or relied upon
in any context.

All governance rules, role definitions, decision authority,
and enforcement mechanisms are defined exclusively
by this Constitution and by the laws located in
`docs/governance/`.

Any reference to deprecated governance artifacts
constitutes a governance violation
and requires an immediate STOP.
